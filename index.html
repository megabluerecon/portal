       <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>
       
        <p>I am an emerging software developer getting my certifications at Seattle Central College. I will be starting my internship in a few short months where I will be able to apply my knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, C# and C++ in the real professional world. I also have background in jobs like fast food and retail where communication with customers is key. This allows me to be well-rounded when talking to people of any culture or background.</p>
       
        <p>My background in technology is a unique one. I was born in Vietnam and lived eight years of my life there. My household was the only one with a computer in my entire neighborhood. This early exposure to computers is what got me latched onto technology and video games at an early age. </p>
       
        <p>My first experience in coding was an intro to computer science class I took in my Sophomore year of high school. I was hooked with the concept and I sought to learn more. The following year, I took AP Computer Science class also offered at my high school. I earned a 4 grade on the AP test and created my first game at the end of that year. In college, I took various coding classes where I learned C#, C++, Java, HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
       
        <p>I am a big computer enthusiast so if you are like me, follow me on LinkedIn and take a look at my GitHub!</p>
